# Code & Design

The idea is to bring [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/) and [DesignNews](https://news.layervault.com) together. I wanted a place where I could view these feeds at the same time.

It's using Sinatra as it's nice and lightweight.

Oh, and I've added some simple tweet button which kind of prefils a tweet ready to post.

Stuff to do:

- Add some kind of caching. At the moment the feeds are pulled and aggregated on the fly which is pretty bad.

Please feel free to fork it and improve :)
